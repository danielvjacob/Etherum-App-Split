# Etherum-App-Split
This is a decentralized web application that hosts a marketplace using the Etherum block chain, specifically the testnet Sepolia.

The website connects with your Meta Mask wallet in order to list and buy items.

Transactions can be viewed on Etherscan or any other block chain explore.

The frontend is a lightweight javascript/html application. The backend is maintained by a smart contract (marketplace.sol) which was compiled on REMIX's ide and deployed to the Sepolia test network.
